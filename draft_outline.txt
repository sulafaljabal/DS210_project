Functions need to be split into modules

Functions needed:
    1- Read file
    2- Hashmap creation for post_id
    3- Extra Hashmap creation for post_id (need numbered 0-n)
    3- Collection of functions for:
        a. Figure out unique numbers of hyperlinks in hashmap
        b. Number of posts that have 1/2/3 hyperlink (more is not necessary)
        c. ???

Current (existing)functions:
    1- ???

Variety of data types
1- Hashmaps
2- Vectors
3- 
*** Enums and structs not likely ***
Structs:
    1- ???

To do
1- Read file - DONE
2- Create hashmap for subreddit numbers - DONE
3- Find subreddit outedges!!
    a- go through list again and create AdjacencyList for each node - DONE
    b- create secondary hashmap for origin subreddit max nodes to outgoing subreddits (need global variable) - DONE
4- Create graph for subreddit to subreddit links - DONE
5- Figure out how to find max value of outgoing nodes for graph_stuff::create_xy function
    a- Use test_junk
6- Figure out plotting stuff 
    a- Go to prof.
